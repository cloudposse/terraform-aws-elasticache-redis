# terraform-aws-elasticache-redis [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-elasticache-redis.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-elasticache-redis) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-elasticache-redis.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-elastic-beanstalk-environment/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Terraform module to provision an [`ElastiCache`](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/) Redis Cluster


---

This project is part of our comprehensive ["SweetOps"](https://docs.cloudposse.com) approach towards DevOps. 


It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).










## Usage

Include this repository as a module in your existing terraform code:

```hcl
// Generate a random string for auth token, no special chars
resource "random_string" "auth_token" {
  length = 64
  special = false
}

module "example_redis" {
  source          = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-elasticache-redis.git?ref=master"
  namespace       = "general"
  name            = "redis"
  stage           = "prod"
  zone_id         = "${var.route53_zone_id}"
  security_groups = ["${var.security_group_id}"]

  auth_token                   = "${random_string.auth_token.result}"
  vpc_id                       = "${var.vpc_id}"
  subnets                      = "${var.private_subnets}"
  maintenance_window           = "wed:03:00-wed:04:00"
  cluster_size                 = "2"
  instance_type                = "cache.t2.micro"
  engine_version               = "4.0.10"
  alarm_cpu_threshold_percent  = "${var.cache_alarm_cpu_threshold_percent}"
  alarm_memory_threshold_bytes = "${var.cache_alarm_memory_threshold_bytes}"
  apply_immediately            = "true"
  availability_zones           = "${var.availability_zones}"

  automatic_failover = "false"
}

output "auth_token" {
  value = "${random_string.auth_token.result}"
}
```
