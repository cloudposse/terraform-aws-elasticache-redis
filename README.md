## Usage

Include this repository as a module in your existing terraform code:

```hcl
module "example_redis" {
  source          = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-elasticache-redis.git?ref=master"
  namespace       = "general"
  name            = "redis"
  stage           = "prod"
  zone_id         = "${var.route53_zone_id}"
  security_groups = ["${var.security_group_id}"]

  vpc_id                       = "${var.vpc_id}"
  subnets                      = "${var.private_subnets}"
  maintenance_window           = "wed:03:00-wed:04:00"
  cluster_size                 = "2"
  instance_type                = "cache.t2.micro"
  engine_version               = "3.2.4"
  alarm_cpu_threshold_percent  = "${var.cache_alarm_cpu_threshold_percent}"
  alarm_memory_threshold_bytes = "${var.cache_alarm_memory_threshold_bytes}"
  apply_immediately            = "true"
  availability_zones           = "${var.availability_zones}"

  automatic_failover = "false"
}
```
