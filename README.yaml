  Terraform module to provision an [`ElastiCache`](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/) Redis Cluster

# How to use this project
# Note: use absolute rather than relative URLs because Hashicorp will copy the README to
# its Terraform Registry website but will not fix relative URLs in the process, leading
# to broken links in the official Terraform documentation.
usage: |-
  _**Disruptive changes introduced at version 0.41.0**. If upgrading from an earlier version, see
  [migration notes](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-elasticache-redis/blob/master/docs/migration-notes-0.41.0.md) for details._

  Note that this uses secure defaults. One of the ways this module can trip users up is with `transit_encryption_enabled`
  which is `true` by default. With this enabled, one does not simply `redis-cli` in without setting up an `stunnel`.
  Amazon provides [good documentation on how to connect with it enabled](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/in-transit-encryption.html#connect-tls).
  If this is not desired behavior, set `transit_encryption_enabled=false`.

  This module creates, by default, a new security group for the Elasticache Redis Cluster. When a configuration
  change (for example, a different security group name) cannot be applied to the security group, Terraform will
  replace that security group with a new one with the new configuration. In order to allow Terraform to fully manage the security group, you
  should not place any other resources in (or associate any other resources with) the security group this module
  creates. Also, in order to keep things from breaking when this module replaces the security group, you should
  not reference the created security group anywhere else (such as in rules in other security groups). If you
  want to associate the cluster with a more stable security group that you can reference elsewhere, create that security group
  outside this module (perhaps with [terraform-aws-security-group](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-security-group))
  and pass the security group ID in via `associated_security_group_ids`.

  **Note about `zone_id`**: Previously, `zone_id` was a string. This caused problems (see [#82](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-elasticache-redis/issues/82)).
  Now `zone_id` should be supplied as a `list(string)`, either empty or with exactly 1 zone ID in order to avoid the problem.

  For a complete example, see [examples/complete](examples/complete).

  For automated tests of the complete example using [bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) and [Terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) (which tests and deploys the example on AWS), see [test](test).
